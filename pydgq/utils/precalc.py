    Parameters are the maximum degree q (>= 1) and the maximum number of visualization points nx (>= 1).

    Since the basis is hierarchical, any lower degree is obtained by simply chopping off the extraneous rows, as y[:(desired_q + 1),:].

    Thus, for visualization, different arrays are needed only for different numbers of points, which are taken to be equally spaced
    on the reference element [-1,1]. Arrays are generated for 1, 2, ..., nx points. Caching (memoization) is used to accelerate
    the computation so that only unique points are actually evaluated (e.g. arrays with 3 and 5 points share the point at 0.0)

    For integration, separate arrays are created, of function values at Gauss-Legendre points for integration rules of order 1,2,...,q+1.
    The q+1 rule is sufficient for evaluation of mass matrices of the form N(x)*N(x) (where N has at most degree q).
    The q rule is sufficient for N'(x)*N(x) (needed in dG(q)) and lower orders. (This is assuming an affine coordinate mapping
    from the reference element to the actual timestep, so that the Jacobian of the coordinate mapping is constant on each element.)

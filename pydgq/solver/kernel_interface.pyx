"""Interface for evaluating the f() in  w' = f(w, t).

These base classes connect the IVP solver with the user-provided custom code
for computing the RHS. Cython and Python interfaces are available.

For a specific, arbitrary nonlinear problem, a custom kernel must be provided.
This can be done in either of two ways:

    - a) implement a cdef class
        - inherit from pydgq.solver.kernel_interface.CythonKernel
        - override __init__(), add any needed parameters, call CythonKernel.__init__(self, n)
        - override cdef callback(...) to compute w' for your RHS

    - b) implement a regular Python class
        - inherit from pydgq.solver.kernel_interface.PythonKernel
        - override __init__(), add any needed parameters, call PythonKernel.__init__(self, n)
        - override def callback(...) to compute w' for your RHS

Cython kernels run in nogil mode, allowing parallel processing of several independent problems.
Useful in use cases with many independent small problems, and for OpenMP based parallel processing
inside callback() (using cython.parallel.prange()).

Python kernels acquire the GIL for each call of callback(). Useful for quick prototyping
of new ODE systems, and for large problems where the Python function call overhead is not significant.

See pydgq.solver.builtin_kernels for some Cython-based example kernels.
